# GitTracker

A tool that can be used to show most recent repo modifed as well as some info
relating to the repo on a WaveShare 2.13" V2 screen mounted to a pi zero W.

Here are the goals that I would like to hit:

- [X] Display most recently modified public repo name.
- [X] Display most recently modified repo including private ones.
- [ ] Display more info regarding repo (name, time edited, etc..)
- [ ] Create a command line version that can be used without the Waveshare e ink display.
